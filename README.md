This bot does exactly what it says. It **Bends Text**. There are various commands which allow people to alter text in various ways.

What if you wanted to have spongebob lettering for someone's text, but don't like alternating the shift key? Well, textbender's got you covered!

Or if you want to space out the letters of your word, but you're too lazy to do it yourself? Well, textbender can help too!
